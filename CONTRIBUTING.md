<b>STEPS TO CONTRIBUTE - </b>

- Fork the project
- Make one or more well commented and clean commits to the repository. You can make a new branch here if you are modifying more than one part or feature.
- Perform a pull request in github's web interface.

If it is a new Feature request, don't start the coding first. Remember to post an issue to discuss the new feature.

If the feature is well discussed and there are some +1 or the project owner approved it, assign the issue to yourself, then do the steps above.
